The main purpose of this project is predicting the desired car from the user's input based on the **size, convenience, irritability, speed and price**. This project is implemented for Artificial Intelligence Course which utilized KNN (k-Nearest Neighbor) algorithm.

# Features
1. Data Preprocessing.
2. Machine Learning Algorithm using KNN
3. Utilizing 4 Methods (Euclidean,Manhattan,Supremmum and Minkowski).
4. CLI User's input
